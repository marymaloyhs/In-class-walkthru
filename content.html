        How do I make a webpage that is really exciting but ultimately the most absolutely boring thing I've ever
        created?

        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>I'm so excited to create this website — it's a place where I'll learn, experiment, and build things I love. I
            can't wait to add more pages, features, and personal touches as I grow my skills.</p>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a
            combination of skills, including coding,<span class="redtext"> this is a span</span> design, and problem solving. Front-end development focuses on what
            users see and interact with, using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development handles
            server-side logic, databases, and application functionality, often using languages such as Python, Java, or
            PHP.
            Web developers also work with frameworks and tools to improve efficiency, security, and performance. As
            technology evolves, web development continues to grow in importance, powering everything from personal blogs
            to
            large-scale e-commerce platforms and social networks worldwide.</p>
